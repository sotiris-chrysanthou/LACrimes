## üìñ **Project Implementation Summary**

This project is based on a previous personal project developed during the **Epsilon Net Coding School course**.  
[Link to the original repository](https://github.com/sotirischrysanthou/Coding-School-2023).

The project fulfills the following objectives:
- **Database Design & Implementation:**  
  Using **.NET 9 Entity Framework** with PostgreSQL. A fully normalized schema was created.
- **SQL Queries:**  
  Implementation & testing of various aggregation, filtering, and trend analysis queries.
- **Web Application:**  
  Features include user registration, login authentication, data search/edit, and query execution.
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  Indexing was added to frequently searched fields, and cascading behavior (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) was implemented.
- **Documentation:**  
  Includes design justifications, code, snapshots of the UI, and all required final information.

## üõ†Ô∏è **SQL Queries**

### Query 1: Find the total number of reports per ‚ÄúCrm Cd‚Äù that occurred within a specified time range and sort them in descending order
```sql
SELECT 
    crm.code AS CrmCd, 
    crm."desc" AS CrimeDescription, 
    COUNT(crm.code) AS TotalReports
FROM crimes crm
INNER JOIN crimeseverities crms ON crms.crimeid = crm.id
INNER JOIN crimesrecords crmr ON crmr.id = crms.crimerecordid
WHERE crmr.dateocc BETWEEN @startdate AND @enddate
    AND crms.severity = @severity
GROUP BY crm.code, crm."desc"
ORDER BY TotalReports DESC;
```

### Query 2: Find the total number of reports per day for a specific ‚ÄúCrm Cd‚Äù and time range.
```sql

```

### Query 3: Find the most common crime committed regardless of code 1, 2, 3, and 4, per area for a specific day.
```sql

```
### Query 4: Find the average number of crimes occurred per hour (24 hours) for a specific date range.
```sql

```
### Query 5: Find the mostcommon‚ÄúCrm Cd‚Äùinaspecifiedboundingbox(asdesignated by GPS-coordinates) for a specific day.
```sql

```
### Query 6:Find the top-5 Area names with regards to total number of crimes reported per day for a specific date range. The same for Rpt Dist No.
```sql

```
### Query 7: Find the pair of crimes that has co-occurred in the area with the most reported incidents for a specific date range.
```sql

```
### Query 8: Find the second most common crime that has co-occurred with a particular crime for a specifi date range.
```sql

```
### Query 9: Find the most common type of weapon used against victims depending on their group of age. The age groups are formed by bucketing ages every 5 years, e.g., 0 ‚â§ x < 5, 5 ‚â§ x < 10, etc..
```sql

```
### Query 10: Find the area with the longest time range without an occurrence of a specific crime. Include the time range in the results. The same for Rpt Dist No.
```sql

```
### Query 11: For 2 crimes of your choice, find all areas that have received more than 1 report on each of these 2 crimes on the same day. The 2 crimes could be for example: ‚ÄúCHILD ANNOYING (17YRS & UNDER)‚Äù or ‚ÄúTHEFT OF IDENTITY‚Äù. Do not restrict yourself to just these 2 specific types of crimes of course!
```sql

```
### Query 12: Find the number of division of records for crimes reported on the same day in different areas using the same weapon for a specific time range.
```sql

```

### Query 13: Find the crimes that occurred for a given number of times N on the same day, in the same area, using the same weapon, for a specific time range. Return the list of division of records numbers, the area name, the crime code description and the weapon description.
```sql

```
